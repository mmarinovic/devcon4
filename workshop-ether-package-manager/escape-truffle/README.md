## Install
```
$ npm install

$ npm test        # vs. ganache-cli
$ npm test:geth   # vs. geth
```

## Deploy

This repository contains deployment scripts that let you quickly publish
your own package registry to a public testnet and authorize your account
address as its owner. There's also a small wizard that helps you register a temporary ENS
namespace for your Ropsten deployed registry so users and tooling can easily reference it when
requesting a package.

### Configuration

Clone the repo and create a `.secrets.js` file in the project root that looks like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ropsten: {
    mnemonic: 'use your own twelve word mnemonic here do not use this one',
    infura: "F6tUooiW4thx777DtPsa" // Example Infura API key.
    ENSName: "my-registry"         // Example ENS name (will register as `my-registry.test`
  },
  rinkeby: {
    ..etc..
  }
}
```

+ Infura API keys are available [here](https://infura.io/register)
+ A 12 word mnemonic (for testing purposes only) can be generated [here](iancoleman.io/bip39)


#### Deployment

At the command line run:
```shell
$ npm run deploy:ropsten
```

#### Temporary ENS Name Registration

After deploying a regisry to Ropsten, and setting an `ENSName` value under the `ropsten` key in your
secrets file, run:

```shell
$ npm run ens:register
```

The name will resolve to your registry's contract address and be valid for 28 days.
